# Payment History

> Your history of paying bills on time. Accounts for 35% of a FICO Score.

How you've paid your bills in the past - whether you've paid on time or late,
or missed payments - is a very important category of credit data for the FICO
Score. The more severe, recent, and frequent the late payment information, the
greater the impact on a FICO Score.

## Late Payments 30+ Days

> Number of your accounts that were ever 30 or more days late, or have a
> derogatory indicator

A reported missed payment or negative description which indicates that an
account has not been paid as agreed.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

About 98% of FICO High Achievers have no missed payments at all.

## Collections

> Number of collections on your credit report

A collection is reported on you when a creditor turns over to a collection
agency any account that you have not repaid. FICO Score 8 only considers
collections with an amount of $100 or greater.

Virtually no FICO High Achievers have a collection listed on their credit
report.

## Derogatory Public Records

> Number of derogatory public records on your credit report

A public record is a legal record reported on you, usually by a court of law.
Derogatory public records can include bankruptcies, foreclosures, garnishments
and tax liens. FICO Score 8 only considers derogatory public records with an
amount of $100 or greater.

Virtually no FICO High Achievers have a public record listed on their credit
report.

## Late Payments 60+ Days

> Number of your accounts that were ever 60 or more days late, or have a
> derogatory indicator

A reported missed payment or negative description which indicates that an
account has not been paid as agreed.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

Virtually no FICO High Achievers have a 60 days late payment or worse listed on
their credit report.

## Accounts Always Paid as Agreed

> Percentage of rated accounts always paid as agreed

The percentage of rated credit accounts reported that have never been reported
as delinquent. A value of 'no valid accounts' means there are no active,
non-disputed accounts reported.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

About 98% of FICO High Achievers have no missed payments at all.

## Time Since Most Recent Late Payment

> Your most recent late payment

The number of months since the most recently reported negative description or
late payment. '0' means you have a currently reported missed payment. 'Unknown'
means there is a missed payment reported, but with no associated date. 'No
delinquent accounts' means you have no accounts reported with missed payments
or negative descriptions.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

About 98% of FICO High Achievers have no missed payments at all. But of those
who do, the missed payment happened nearly 4 years ago, on average.

# Amount of Debt

> Your total amount of outstanding debt. Accounts for 30% of a FICO score.

The amount of credit you're using is a very important category of
credit data for the FICO Score. FICO Scores consider the total balance
owed, how many accounts have balances and how much of your available
credit you're using.

## Revolving Utilization

> Percentage of your revolving balances to your revolving credit limits

The ratio of the sum of the balances on revolving accounts divided by
the sum of the credit limits on revolving accounts reported. 'No valid
accounts' means there are no revolving accounts reported or no active,
non-disputed revolving accounts reported.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

For FICO High Achievers, the average ratio is less than 7%.

## Accounts with Balances

> Number of your accounts with a balance

The number of accounts that have a balance being reported. 'No valid
accounts' means there are no active, non-disputed accounts reported.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

FICO High Achievers have an average of 3 accounts carrying a balance.

## Total Balance on Revolving and Open-Ended Accounts

> Total owed on revolving accounts

The sum of balances being reported on Open-ended Accounts (such as a
charge card) and/or Revolving Accounts (such as a credit card) that
are reported as open. 'No valid accounts' means there are no
Open-ended or Revolving accounts reported or no active, non-disputed
Open-ended or Revolving open accounts reported.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

Most FICO High Achievers owe less than $2500 on revolving accounts
such as credit cards and department store cards.

# Length of Credit History

> How long you've had credit. Accounts for 15% of a FICO Score.

FICO Scores take into account how long your credit accounts have been
established, including the age of your oldest account, the age of your newest
account and the average age of all your accounts.

## Average Age of Accounts

> The average age of your accounts

FICO Scores consider the average age of all accounts being reported. Generally
speaking, having a relatively long credit history and not opening many new
accounts is reflective of lower credit risk.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

Most FICO High Achievers have an average age of accounts of 9 years or more.

## Age of Oldest Account

> Time since your oldest account was opened

FICO Scores consider the age of the oldest account being reported. Generally
speaking, having a relatively long credit history is reflective of lower credit
risk.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

FICO High Achievers opened their oldest account 25 years ago, on average.

# Amount of New Credit

> Amount of credit you've recently obtained or applied for. Accounts for 10% of
> a FICO Score.

When considering your amount of new credit, FICO Scores take into account how
many new accounts you've recently opened and whether you've been rate shopping
for a single loan or applying for multiple new credit lines. Opening several
new credit accounts in a short period of time indicates greater credit risk.

## Age of Most Recently Opened Account

> Time since your newest account was opened

FICO Scores consider how recently a new credit account was opened. People how
recently opened a credit account are generally more risky to lenders than
people with no recently opened accounts.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

FICO High Achievers opened their most recent account 2 years and 6 months ago,
on average.

## Number of Recent Inquiries

> Your applications for credit in the past year

While FICO Scores typically consider the number of inquiries on a credit report
from the past twelve months, the number of inquiries is a much less important
factor than late payments, total amount owed and length of credit history.

70% of FICO High Achievers did not apply for credit in the past year.

# Credit Mix

> What types of credit you're using. Accounts for 10% of a FICO Score.

FICO Scores consider the different types of credit accounts being used or
reported, including credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans and
mortgage loans. Your credit mix will be more important if your credit report
doesn't have a lot of other information to base a FICO Score on.

## Revolving Accounts

> Number of revolving accounts being used or reported

FICO Scores evaluate the mix of different types of credit being used or
reported. Revolving accounts are credit accounts in which the monthly payment
varies based on the amount owed. The borrower may defer or ('revolve') payment
on part of the balance. The lender will charge interest on any unpaid balance.
Revolving accounts include credit card accounts. Credit mix is a much less
important category of credit data than late payments, total amount owed and
length of credit history.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

FICO High Achievers have an average of 12 revolving accounts.

## Bank-Issued Credit Card Accounts

> Number of credit cards being used or reported

FICO Scores evaluate the mix of different types of credit being used or
reported. Bank-issued credit card accounts are a subset of revolving accounts.
Credit mix is a much less important category of credit data than late payments,
total amount owed and length of credit history.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

FICO High Achievers have an average of 7 credit cards.

## Installment Loans, Including Mortgages

> Number of installment loans, including mortgages, being used or reported

FICO Scores evaluate the mix of different types of credit being used or
reported. Installment accounts are credit accounts that have a fixed payment
for a fixed period of time. Installment accounts are usually for a single large
purchase (e.g., auto or home). For the calculation of this attribute,
installment accounts include mortgages. Credit mix is a much less important
category of credit data than late payments, total amount owed and length of
credit history.

Authorized user accounts aren't considered in the calculation of this
attribute.

FICO High Achievers have an average of 5 installment accounts.
