title: System Tray for Evolution
---
Evolution is an open source email client that is similar to Microsoft Outlook.
At the time when I first encountered Evolution, the software didn't have the
ability to minimize to system tray. Since it is open source, I took it upon
myself to add features that I wanted. I downloaded Evolution source code and
then added system tray features to it. The most difficult part of the project
was figuring out how Evolution code works because there is no code comments or
documentation for it. The actual amount of code I wrote was small and is about
300 lines of code.

The result of my work can be seen through the following screenshots:
