title: About Me
---
I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2007 and then started working
full-time at Microsoft. I spent 4 years at Microsoft having a blast writing
things for mobile phones and most recently worked on the Windows Phone 7 Bing
Maps application. After 4 years at Microsoft, I returned back to Canada to work
for Well.ca. Prior to my full-time job experiences, I had a total of 2 years of
[work experience][1] through internships at Amazon.com, Microsoft, ScanSoft,
and Intrafinity.com.

In my spare time, I love to tinker with technology and I love to write code to
make my ideas come true. Check out some of my [past projects][2]!
  
**Making a Difference**

I believe that many people have the same ideas, but the difference makers are
people who think of an idea and pursue it to make it happen. "You stole my
idea!" is what somebody once jokingly said to me after seeing what I coded up.
In reality I didn't steal any ideas, but what I did was I followed through with
something I thought of. Persistence and never giving up are two things I value
a lot.

Here is a list of things I did that I'm most proud of:
- Wrote a speech recognizer named [OCVolume][3] in high school (I received
  [numerous emails][4] after I put it up on SourceForge)
- Developed Home Screen Customizer application in my spare time that was later
  bundled by Microsoft on all Huawei C8300 phones ([Featured on Microsoft China
  website][5]!)
- Tackled open-ended problems and did research in high school and at Amazon.com
- Shipping Bing Search &amp; Maps applications on Windows Phone 7
- Proposed and prototyped an idea for Maps application on Windows Phone 7 that
  is currently being implemented for a future release

**How I Got Started**

The Turing programming language I learned in grade 10 sparked my interest in
computers. I had so much fun programming games in Turing that I taught myself
Visual Basic during the summer before grade 11. Then in grade 12, my school
teacher taught us Java and let the class pick any project we choose. I decided
to learn about Genetic Programming, and I also wrote a speech recognizer as a
group project that became [OCVolume][3]! The speech
recognizer project was a defining moment for me in high school because I
tackled an open-ended problem to which I didn't know the solution to. There
were many obstacles such as encountering Fast Fourier Transform before
university, trying to understand and implement Hidden Markov Models, and making
use of K-Means and vector quantization algorithms. In the end, my group was
able to create a recognizer that could differentiate between words, and we used
it to control Lego Mindstorms robot using voice commands. That was lots of fun!
