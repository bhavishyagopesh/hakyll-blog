title: About Me
---
After graduating from the University of Waterloo I started working at Microsoft
playing with mobile phones. Most recently I worked on the Windows Phone 7 Bing
Maps application before leaving Seattle. I returned back to Canada to work for
Canadian start-up Well.ca. At Well.ca I led the warehouse software team, and I
also worked on several mobile apps. Having seen both large companies and small
start-ups, I am now trying to start a start-up as my next challege. See [this
page][1] for more details about my work experience.

In my spare time, I love to tinker with technology and I love to write code to
make my ideas come true. Check out some of my [past projects][2]!

**Making a Difference**

I believe that many people have the same or similar ideas, but the difference
makers are people who pursue ideas to make them happen. "You stole my idea!" is
what someone once jokingly said to me after seeing what I coded up.
Unfortunately dreaming about something doesn't bring it to reality. Persistence
and never giving up are two things I value a lot.

Here is a list of things I did that I'm most proud of:

- Wrote a speech recognizer named [OCVolume][3] in high school (I received
  [numerous emails][4] after I put it up on SourceForge)
- Developed Home Screen Customizer application in my spare time achieving over
  150,000 downloads and later bundled by Microsoft on all Huawei C8300 phones
  ([Featured on Microsoft China website][5]!)
- Tackled open-ended problems and did research in high school and at Amazon.com
- Shipped Bing Search &amp; Maps applications on Windows Phone 7
- Proposed and prototyped a new driving navigation experience that became an
  official feature on Windows Phone 7 Mango release
