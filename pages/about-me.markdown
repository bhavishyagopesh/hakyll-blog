In my spare time, I love to tinker with technology and I love to write code to
make my ideas come true. Check out some of my [past projects][2]!

**Making a Difference**

I believe that many people have the same or similar ideas, but the difference
makers are people who pursue ideas to make them happen. "You stole my idea!" is
what someone once jokingly said to me after seeing what I coded up.
Unfortunately dreaming about something doesn't bring it to reality. Persistence
and never giving up are two things I value a lot.

Here is a list of things I did that I'm most proud of:

- Wrote a speech recognizer named [OCVolume][3] in high school (I received
  [numerous emails][4] after I put it up on SourceForge)
- Developed Home Screen Customizer application in my spare time achieving over
  150,000 downloads and later bundled by Microsoft on all Huawei C8300 phones
  ([Featured on Microsoft China website][5]!)
- Tackled open-ended problems and did research in high school and at Amazon.com
- Proposed and prototyped a new driving navigation experience that became an
  official feature on Windows Phone 7 Mango release
