### Co-founder and CTO at [Kash Corp.](http://withkash.com) (YC S14) (September 2012 to Present)

We get rid of credit card fees! Credit card fees are a tax on everything. Every
time you swipe a credit card, there are 13 steps to clear that transaction and
each middleman is taking a cut. This is why retailers are being gouged a large
percentage of their revenue just for accepting paperless money. It doesn't have
to be this way! At Kash, we're taking on Visa, MasterCard, and the banks by
giving power to retailers with the latest technology and an app that allows
consumers to pay their local businesses. Our system is faster than using a
credit card and saves local businesses.

Join the fight. [End Credit Card Fees](http://endcreditcardfees.com).


### Co-founder and CTO at [AvidTap Corp.](http://avidtap.com) (September 2012 to Present)

We believe that retailers need help and we’re coming to their rescue.
AvidTap is the mobile retail company that is bringing the e-commerce
way of selling things to brick & mortar retail. We help retailers start, run
and grow their businesses with our mobile retail platform. Next time an AvidTap
user walks into an AvidTap powered retail store, her profile will pop up on the
POS, the retailer can greet her by her name and relate to her based on her past
shopping experience.
