title: Past Personal Projects
---
This page lists some of my past projects that I did during my spare time for
fun. I'm always tinkering with technology whether it is writing something for
my smartphone, or writing a webservice for myself, or customizing open source
software obsessively to my liking.

Also see [github][3] for my past projects.
