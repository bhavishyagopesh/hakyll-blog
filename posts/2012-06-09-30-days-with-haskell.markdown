My 30-day challenge: Learn Haskell by studying at least 30 minutes a day while
I eat breakfast.

I gave a presentation yesterday to developers at Well.ca about what I learned
from my 30-day challenge. There were things that the development team can take
from functional programming and apply to our day job of using PHP. My
presentation slides [here](/files/presentations/haskell/) show
features of Haskell and how it contrasts with PHP equivalent or PHP practices.

Just before I left Microsoft, I learned from one of the Engineering Forum talks
that some teams there actually do learn one new programming language a year as
a team. I thought that was really cool and wanted to challenge myself. I
specifically wanted to learn a functional language because I keep reading about
Haskell, Scala, Clojure, Erlang, Common Lisp, etc. The promise of no
side-effects and easier time with concurrency were big draws for me. Also, I
wanted to really challenge myself by learning a paradigm I was not familiar
with. I am learning Objective-C just because of what I do at work, but that
language is not a huge change for me in terms of how I think. My past
experience from mobile development transfers really easily to iOS development.

At this time I finished reading the book [Learn You a Haskell for Great
Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) by Miran Lipovača, and I'm a third of the
way through [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/)
by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen. I also played with yesod
web framework a little bit going through the [tutorial by Yann
Esposito](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Yesod-tutorial-for-newbies/) and
the [Haskell and Yesod book](http://www.yesodweb.com/book).
