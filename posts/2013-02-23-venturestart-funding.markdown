Yay! [AvidTap][1] got some funding from [VentureStart][2]. Thanks to Sarah
Lenarcic, Nathan Monk and our [MaRS][3] advisors for guiding us through the
process.  It's been an up and down journey so far, so even though we're not
massively successful yet this is a small victory nonetheless.

This past week I coded up some websockets stuff, pitched to investors, and
played tech support on the phone. I helped onboard our first store whose owner
Hogan is just an awesome guy. We have other stores lined up waiting to get
their package. Stay tuned.

There has been lots of first time experiences for me and that's great. As with
any challenge, I say "Bring It!".
