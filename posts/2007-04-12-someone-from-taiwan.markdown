The OCVolume category contains posts with emails I received
regarding [OCVolume](http://ocvolume.sf.net). Close to when I am about to
graduate from university, I heard from someone in Taiwan inquiring about
OCVolume.

We exchanged multiple emails because the person was about to immigrate to
Canada and I was also an immigrant to Canada so there are some similarities.

My experience at ScanSoft told me that the money in speech industry is no
longer in the core recognizer but in the customized solutions surrounding it. I
worked on custom solutions for telephone speech solutions and decided that
isn't for me long term.
