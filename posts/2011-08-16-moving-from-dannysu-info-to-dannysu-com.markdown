title: Moving from dannysu.info to dannysu.com
tags: Miscellaneous, domain name
---
Three months ago I got spammed by someone saying that the domain "dannysu.com"
will soon be publicly on sale and I'll have a chance to make an offer to buy
it. Here's a quote from the spam email, "dannysu.com is for sale to the public
worldwide. Interested buyers can and do make offers."

Well, I read up on [how expired domains work][1] and then decided that I can
just wait it out. I was already using dannysu.info, so having the dot com is
nice but not necessary. I figured that nobody wants my name as the domain and
it turned out to be true. A little while ago I checked again and was able to
register dannysu.com, so I'm transfering everything to dannysu.com and I'll
just let the .info domain expire.
