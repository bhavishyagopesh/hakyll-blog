Before today all I had for proving that my Home Screen Customizer hobby project was shipped on Huawei C8300 phones in China is a piece of email some PM sent to me at work. However, today I found actual screenshots on Microsoft China web pages that showed my app!

You can see screenshots of my recent programs panel (top 2 screenshots) and the configuration interface I wrote (bottom of the page) here:

The above page is linked from Microsoft China's page on Huawei C8300:

It feels so much more real having screenshots of the page, and it's great to see that my hobby project made a difference in shipping this phone!

I'm mirroring these webpages here as well:
