Before today all I had for proving that my Home Screen Customizer hobby project
was shipped on Huawei C8300 phones in China is a piece of email some PM sent to
me at work. However, today I found actual screenshots on Microsoft China web
pages that showed my app!

You can see screenshots of my recent programs panel (top 2 screenshots) and the
configuration interface I wrote (bottom of the page) here:  
[http://www.microsoft.com/china/windowsphone/tips/huawei_c8300/DeviceFeatures_huawei_c8300_94.html][1]

The above page is linked from Microsoft China's page on Huawei C8300:  
[http://www.microsoft.com/china/windowsphone/phone/Huawei-C8300.aspx#tabs-4][2]

It feels so much more real having screenshots of the page, and it's great to
see that my hobby project made a difference in shipping this phone!

I'm mirroring these webpages here as well:
