title: Another prototype, another prize won
tags: Microsoft
---
My current team is quite awesome. We just had our 2nd ProtoFest, and I'm really
happy people liked my idea. ProtoFest is just an event when anybody can show
off their prototype, and we have various prizes that people vote on to
determine the winners.

In the first ProtoFest, I showed off a bunch of ideas and won the "The Kitchen
Magician" (as seen on TV). Yes, the prizes are generally some silly, random,
sometimes cool things.

The 2nd ProtoFest had a bigger prize in the form of a xbox/kinect combo (among
other random prizes). There were about 10 demos, and we voted for our favorite
prototype by writing the presenter's name on post-it notes. While the votes
were being counted, our release manager got people to raise their hands to vote
for the random prizes. I won a "remote controlled fart machine".

After the votes were counted, the lead PM announced that there was a tie
between my mentor Adrian and me. So we were asked to close our eyes and they
again had people raise hands to vote. It turned out that we reached a tie
again! At that point I think the GPM decided that both Adrian and I would win a
xbox/kinect combo. I am happy people liked my idea and I won a xbox for doing
nothing more than what I like to do. When I finally receive it, I plan to
donate it to somebody (maybe children's hospital).
