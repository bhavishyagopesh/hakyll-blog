Intense side-scrolling action! :D

thnx to Johnny Yip (who's high addicted to Abuse) that told me about this game
;)

I was browsing through my FreeBSD ports collection for games, hoping to find
Unreal Tournament or Quake 3 to test my ATI card... Johnny saw Abuse and
immediately got excited :)

After compiling the source... I still couldn't get the game running. However,
after a bit of search on google, I found the solution to my problem.

Basically I need to create a folder in my home directory and create a file. The
commands for doing both of these tasks are listed below:

```bash
mkdir ~/.abuse
echo '(setq darkest_gray 40)' > ~/.abuse/gamma.lsp
```
