written by me

I simply can't stand evolution 2.0 doesn't have systray support...

developers are working on 2.2 with its new EPlugin system. on mailing-list, one of the dev's said they already have a patch for systray waiting to be ported to EPlugin.

that's gonna take a while before they get to it though, so I started working on a patch for v2.0.2 to allow me to use systray for the time being.

it's hard to figure things out when you're looking at somebody else's code for the first time ever!!!
took me saturday and sunday before I finally found something that works

here's my [patch](/files/gentoo/evolution.systray.patch.zip)
