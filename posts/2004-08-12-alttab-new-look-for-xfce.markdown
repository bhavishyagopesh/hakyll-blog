Much better than the default

See [screenshot](http://vovan.homelinux.org/files/xfwm4-cvs/tabwin.jpg).
Vovan from XFCE forum posted this patch, which made Alt + Tab much better to use now.

You can apply the patch to current CVS src... just take out the first block that it's patching, it's no longer needed.
Everything else patched cleanly

I made a mirror of the patch [here](/files/gentoo/client.patch).
