that's right! I found my new love :)

she's my love source: linux kernel-2.6.5-love4 :D
basically a set of patches for the linux kernel put together by some people @ Gentoo forums.

What I do want to mention is the built-in supermount feature.
since I've been lazy and haven't got around to find out how to get supermount, love-source is great!
saves me time.

supermount basically allows you to use your cdroms or dvdroms without manually mount or umount!
finally linux got rid of that usability issue...

just put your cd in and go!

here's where you can get the latest:
