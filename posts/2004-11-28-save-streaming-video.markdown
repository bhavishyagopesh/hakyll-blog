so how do you save streaming video on linux?

The question came to me when I wanted to show Murat a commercial of Katamari
Damashi (a great game!).  
Murat's IE is messed up and he can't play streaming video. :(

I knew that on windows I could use StreamBox to save video serving on mms://
protocol. What about on Linux???

After searching for a bit I found this: [http://www.geocities.com/majormms/][1]

after "./configure && make" I was able to grab the commercial and send the
actual video to Murat :D

good stuff! that's one more dependency on Windows gone!

I mirrored [THE FILE](/files/gentoo/mms_client-0.0.3.tar.gz) on my own server
just because it's convenient for myself.
