need another reason why use FreeBSD? or *BSD?

Netcraft.com has statistics on top hosting providers. In June, the top 5 hosts
were all occupied by companies running FreeBSD. In July, 5 out of the top 10
runs FreeBSD and 7/top13 runs FreeBSD.

FreeBSD has "The Power to Serve"! Not only that, it's great for home usage!
While considering alternatives to Windows, and even alternative to Linux, try
out FreeBSD since it won't disappoint you! You do need to spend time to learn
the OS though, or else you won't be able to appreciate it.
