I hope whoever reads this go and take the first step towards their dream or
towards a cause they're passionate about. Just start with one step first.

I was reminded again last week of the power of a goal. It reminds me of the
relentless pursuit of championships for NBA players. It reminds me of the
camaraderie my team had when introducing the world to a radical change in UX
direction for Windows Phone. It reminds me of my company [Kash][4]'s mission to
kill the stranglehold of credit cards on in-person paperless payment. It reminds
me of Indiegogo's mission. It reminds me of Ang Lee's dream.

## **Indiegogo's Story**

You should really read up on [this interview][2] and [this interview][1] with
Indiegogo's Danae Ringelmann. There are so many great things she talks about in
regards to Indiegogo's mission to "democratize finance". Danae speaks of her
desire to provide a "gatekeeper-free way for any small business to access
capital". I love it. Equal opportunities for all in life is something I feel as
important. Similarly I feel that "education for all" is also an important goal
that organizations like Khan Academy is doing.

Home in on a goal is probably the easiest way to be relentless. Danae recalls her
feeling, "I almost felt like it was my duty to see this idea through, like the
world needed me to see this idea through." Now that's a powerful drive. Danae
also says that they'll never lose sight of the mission and how every decision
being made are being influenced by that goal.

That's the power of the mission.

## **Ang Lee's Story**

I was reminded of Ang Lee's struggles and triumphs as they were so movingly
[documented][3]. He had a dream job doing something atypical of most people's
careers. Through extremely hard times and helped by people around him, he was
finally able to achieve his dream.

The goal is so powerful.

However, as moving as Ang's story is, it's very important to move past feelings and
towards action. Danae touched on this as well. You don't achieve your dream by
daydreaming. You achieve your dream by taking the first step to overcome
inertia, and then keep taking the next step.
