The famous CS Real-Time Programming course has just starting to extend its claws into my student life in my last school term. Assignment 1 which caused me to spend hours and hours in the trains lab is only a small part and the most easy portion of the course.

For those unfamiliar with the course, see that there was an article written about it: [http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs452/images/big_news.jpg](http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs452/images/big_news.jpg)

The course web page can be found at [http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs452/](http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs452/)

The RTOS QNX has its roots in the CS452 course as well.

Those trains in the newspaper article looks nicer than the ones I'm currently working with. The hardware has a lot of faulty or broken parts. The lack of documentation and confusing information make the assignment more difficult than it should be.

That said, playing around with trains is fun. I was very excited to see my trains move the first time. When I get a figure 8 going I'll be sure to take a video :lol:
