Every company and every industry is comprised of people that are in it for the
right reasons and the rest who are just going through the motions. The teaching
profession is no different. However, I have a lot of respect for great teachers
and I had the good fortune to have seen some of them at work. Below are some
examples.
<br>
<br>

## **Ability to Transfer Knowledge**

Transferring knowledge is not easy and I've had experienced some of that myself.

For a credit in high school, I helped as a teaching assistant in a grade 10
programming class. I remember having a hard time transferring the programming
knowledge I already obtained to other younger students. I remember attempting to
explain concepts in different ways. If one way doesn't work, I tried another.

Later in university I also often felt that the course materials could be
explained in ways that might be more understandable. When I finally
understood something the professor was teaching, I sometimes think to myself
that the concept could be explained in a differently way and I would've had
easier time getting it.

This is one of the reasons why I respect teachers for what they do. Some
teachers are better than others at this. Certainly some professors are much
better than others at this.

## **Passionate**

I love seeing people who are passionate about what they do. The excitement rubs
off on others. I think of my university math professor who showed a genuine love
for his area. This professor even held extra sessions outside of classes to show
students math applications in the real world. I hope everyone knows why they're
learning something and the impact in the real world it has. Math is truly
amazing and has so many applications.

## **Caring**

I wish people are in the profession they're in because they care, or at least
have the integrity to do things well. In Seattle I met some teachers who really
cared about the students and I have so much respect for them.

The teachers I met not only spent their own money but also spent their time to
tutor kids from low income family after school. Each kid gets a snack and have a
chance to win some prizes each time they come to the tutoring sessions. The
education system doesn't pay for this. It is unaffected by budget cuts. It comes
from teachers' love for the kids. One of the teachers even brought her sister
and mother to help.

In our society time is even more expensive than money. The fact that there are
teachers that go above and beyond their "job" is awesome. It's like software
companies wanting to find hackers who tinker with stuff and contribute to
open-source projects. Teachers like these show that they really care and they
became teachers for very good reasons.

## **Motivator**

The best thing that some teachers gave me was simply the fact that they
challenged the class to do more than they ever imagined they could. Parents and
teachers shouldn't always make things too easy for kids. It doesn't help with
their self-esteem having things the easy way.

As it had been the tradition for several years in my high school, the OAC
programming class involves a final project of students' choosing. My teacher
simply allowed the students to choose whatever challenge they wanted to tackle.
My group went on and created [OCVolume][1] and the experience of overcoming
something so big at the time really built up my confidence.

The teachers would stay after school's over and supervise us in the computer
lab. They don't necessarily know how to tackle the programming issues we were
working on, but the best thing is the time they spent and the environment they
created.
<br>
<br>

These are reasons why I have a lot of respect for great teachers. I've had my
share of teachers who don't care. Some teachers don't even know students'
names after one whole semester. But whenever I think of bad teachers, I remind
myself that in any large group there are always those who are in it for the
right reasons. You just know it when you see it.
