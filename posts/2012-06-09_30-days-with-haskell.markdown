My 30-day challenge: Learn Haskell by studying at least 30 minutes a day while I eat breakfast.

I gave a presentation yesterday to developers at Well.ca about what I learned from my 30-day challenge. There were things that the development team can take from functional programming and apply to our day job of using PHP. My presentation slides <a href="http://dannysu.com/presentations/haskell/" target="_blank">here</a> show features of Haskell and how it contrasts with PHP equivalent or PHP practices.

Just before I left Microsoft, I learned from one of the Engineering Forum talks that some teams there actually do learn one new programming language a year as a team. I thought that was really cool and wanted to challenge myself. I specifically wanted to learn a functional language because I keep reading about Haskell, Scala, Clojure, Erlang, Common Lisp, etc. The promise of no side-effects and easier time with concurrency were big draws for me. Also, I wanted to really challenge myself by learning a paradigm I was not familiar with. I am learning Objective-C just because of what I do at work, but that language is not a huge change for me in terms of how I think. My past experience from mobile development transfers really easily to iOS development.

At this time I finished reading the book <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/" target="_blank">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a> by Miran Lipovaƒça, and I'm a third of the way through <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/" target="_blank">Real World Haskell</a> by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen. I also played with yesod web framework a little bit going through the <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Yesod-tutorial-for-newbies/" target="_blank">tutorial by Yann Esposito</a> and the <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/book" target="_blank">Haskell and Yesod book</a>.
