I did a brain dump of my [YC interview experience][2] before and gave advice on
people's YC applications. Today I want to point out that we've published the
successful application we wrote so anyone can take a peek.

Check out the application and the video on the Kash blog:

Some of our approach and strategy isn't the same as what's in our application
anymore. That's because of the learnings we've had since we wrote it. However,
the main underpinning of our thinking hasn't changed at all.

Looking back, it's interesting to note that we actually built a whole Venmo for
Canada in one month. When I talked about my YC interview experience, the P2P
experiment was what we did between getting accepted into YC and the official
start date of YC. We were cranking at full speed. That was when I cranked out
the iPhone app in a week and when Kaz got us the necessary legal paperwork in
Canada. We aren't doing that anymore based on what we saw, but I've seen other
startups and mega corps looking into it since then. I wish them good luck!

Sometimes people ask whether they should apply, and I'd tell them that working
through the YC application is an excellent way to ask yourself some hard
questions. The way I like to think about it is in terms of convincing myself
that whatever I'm working on is worth the life I'm spending on it. What
evidences do you have that convinces you of that? What secrets and contrarian
believes have you found that others don't share? What domain knowledge and
insights about people have you discovered?
