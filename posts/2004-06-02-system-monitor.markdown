no, not GKrellM or similar non-minimalistic stuff like that

for the longest time, I wanted something like Coolmon or Samurize on Linux
nothing but pure text

maybe it's because I never searched enough
or the fact that there's nobody out there who wants the same as me

to me, stuff like GKrellM is plain ugly
I hate having lotta stuff on my screen basically

I ended up just downloading source for gnu tools like "free", "top", etc
and did a bunch of copy & paste to get what I named "[sysmon](/files/gentoo/sysmon/sysmon.tar.bz2)".

it looks like this:
![](/files/gentoo/sysmon/sysmon.png)

nice, simple, minimal
that's what I like.
