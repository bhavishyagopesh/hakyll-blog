It’ll be in stores this year, and people will get to experience the cool stuff my team and I made. Some of the very things that I coded are pointed out in this preview as highlights: [http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/19/windows-phone-7-in-depth-preview/](http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/19/windows-phone-7-in-depth-preview/)

Engadget reviewers particularly liked the directions list view in Maps, which is one of the things I worked on for WP7 :)
