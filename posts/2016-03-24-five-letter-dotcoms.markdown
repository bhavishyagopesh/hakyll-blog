description: Available five letter .com domains
---
A little while ago I came across [Flippa][1]. It's a marketplace that allows
people to sell domain names they own. It was surprising to me to see 4-letter
domain names being sold on there. I guess I just haven't been paying attention
to domain names. Aside from .com domains, I also saw 4-letter .org domain names
like [ocag.org][2] being sold. A 4-letter .org piqued my interest since it's
short, but I really don't know whether I should buy one or not. Instead of
doing an impulse purchase I waited and decided to investigate a bit. In order
to get a sense of what's out there, I wrote a script that allows me to
exhaustively check for domain availability. I'll go through the details below,
but basically unless it's a 4-letter combination that you like don't waste your
money. There are still a bunch of random 4-letter .org left.

# 4-letter English Word .org

First, I grabbed a list of common English words that are 4 letters long and I
ran the list through my checker. At the end of it I actually found *sild.org*
still available, but it wasn't that great of a domain so I didn't grab it.
Interestingly it was taken by a squatter couple hours later on the same day. So
now there are probably no 4-letter English word .org left.

# 4 Random Letter .org

Next I generated all possible 4-letter domains (excluding ones containing
numbers) and checked them all. I found that there are still around two thousand
4-letter .org left when I checked. This is why if you're just buying some
random 4-letter .org, then it's not worth it unless it's a combination you
like.

For example, *ayyo.org* at the time of writing is still available. It's pretty
nice and if all you're looking for is a short domain, why pay someone else when
you can just find an available one. In my opinion ayyo.org is even nicer than
ocag.org and sild.org. Looking on Flippa, you also see other garbage domains
being sold for $25 like fngr.org or sdhd.org.

No thanks.

I won't publish everything I found here because I don't want to help squatters
too much. Contact me if you want me to suggest one for you, or frankly write a
script and go check it yourself.

# Common English Word .org

I also grabbed a list of common English words and checked those for .org
availability. Nothing really all that interesting to me in there, but there are
800+ available so maybe there's something for you. Like for example
*dropsy.org* is available at the time of writing. If you like it, consider it a
reward for reading this post. Also available: jerkin.org & zshops.org.

# 5-letter & 6-letter .org

I also checked for longer lengths to see what's out there. 
There are still interesting stuff that you can grab. *cutesy.org* was
available when I checked, but looks like it got registered at the end of
February. *sixmo.org* is available at the time of writing if that's of interest
to anyone.

In general though, I only really care about .com. I bought a .org before and
experienced first-hand having to remind my wife that it's a .org.

# 4-letter .com

On Flippa you also see 4-letter .com domain names being sold. Those are a
different story. I checked all 4-letter .com domain names and indeed they're
all gone. I didn't check for names including digits since I'm not all that
interested in those, but I expect those to be taken too. So if somebody is
selling a 4-letter .com you like, go for it.

# 5-letter .com

My exploration continues to 5-letter .com domain names. There are 82977 still
available when I checked couple months ago. You can find things like
*dvdyo.com* (DVD Yo! For those starting a DVD shop in 2016) and *aomae.com*.
There's actually someone with aomae WordPress blog, so if he/she wants a .com
it's just sitting there.

# Conclusion

In the end I have a much better picture of the remaining availability and can
better judge if I should pull the trigger on some random domains I come across.
I don't want to publish everything since that'll just help squatters, but if
you're just looking for a short random letters domain then send me a note.
