like the name suggests, it's for checking gmail account for new email

you might know that there's already gtray for windows:

and there's also gtray for unix: <http://fraggle.alkali.org/projects/gtray/>  

furthermore, there's GMailCheck for gdesklet and I believe there's something
for KDE users too!

I use XFCE CVS myself, but gtray for unix requires ruby-gnome binding... that
requires me to install 10 other programs just for a simple mail checker!!!
&gt;:(

seeing that I might actually use gmail, last night I wrote something using
[GTK][1] and [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)...

It's very barebone right now since I have exams in a week, I can't spend too
much time on it.

you can check out my program [here](/files/gentoo/gmailtray.tar.gz).
