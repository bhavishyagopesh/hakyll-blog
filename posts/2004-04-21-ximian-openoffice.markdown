pronounced... well, however you pronounce it... I do zim ian

anyways, I've been using OpenOffice for work related stuff (I bring work home
so I can leave office early...), and I've used it for writing my resume couple
days ago.

I just figured out how to get spellcheck working in OOWriter, here's the link:

There's a macro that will do the installation :)

There is one defect I find in OO though...
When reading WORD document, it doesn't read the page layout properly

for example, I've written a 188 page functional specification for work, and
half of it is in landscape mode... when reading in OO, that layout just gets
lost :(
