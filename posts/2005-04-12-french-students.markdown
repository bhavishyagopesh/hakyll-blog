The OCVolume category contains posts with emails I received regarding [OCVolume](http://ocvolume.sf.net/). I love how open source projects can help connect people from all over the world! This time from French speaking places.


> hello,
We are french students and we want to use ocvolume
for speech recognition for our project because it's very
interesting.
But i want to lower the number of record for a word.
how can we do that?
Is it a good idea...?
Thank you for your answer.
