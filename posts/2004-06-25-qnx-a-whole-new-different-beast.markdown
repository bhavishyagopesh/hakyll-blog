no more killing!

KILL? that's for linux and unix

for QNX, you would SLAY

My current task for the aerial robotics group (WARG) is to write an interfacing
program to read images off camera sensors through I2C bus.

Today I tried to write a little program to read off the temperature sensor on
octagon 5070 board...

in the process, I learned about "slay" :)  
what sounds better?  
killall io-net  
-or-  
SLAY io-net!
