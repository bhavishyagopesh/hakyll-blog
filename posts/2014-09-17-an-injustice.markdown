When I was thinking about starting a startup, I thought about figuring out what
other professions are struggling with, then see if there's a technology solution
to that. It seems that my journey took a rather roundabout way to finally learn
what local retailer's biggest pain point is. Through all of our previous product
executions, we learned and talked to store owners. We experimented and found out
things about the world. These learning drive our insight in coming up with
[Kash][1].

What we discovered is that there is this injustice in the world. One of the
biggest pains local businesses have is their credit card fees. When we talked to
store owners, one of them was almost in tears telling us how the credit card
industry hurts her livelihood so much. Another owner doesn't mind telling us how
much he makes. This store owner takes home $60,000 a year after all expenses.
One of those expenses is the credit card fees, and the credit card industry takes
home $72,000! A store owner does all the work for his business only to have the
credit card industry make more money. This is just plain wrong!

And to rub salt in the wound, every "innovation" around mobile payment thus far
have not been designed to help your neighbourhood businesses. Every new entrant
focuses on establishing themselves as yet another middleman in the pipeline of
people that take a cut on credit card fees.

At Kash, we're changing that. We're creating an ethical payment option to fight
the credit card monopoly. We're focusing on creating something consumers love to
use to pay, and a solution that helps to keep local businesses thriving. Check
out our [job postings][2]. I'd love to chat.
