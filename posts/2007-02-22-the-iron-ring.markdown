The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer is something that aims to bind engineers together, and the iron ring being part of the ritual certainly contributes to that effect. The iron ring is something that only Engineers and Engineering students in Canada have. It has been patented to ensure that it remains special and remains an unique reminder to engineers of their responsibilities. The ring is to be worn on a person's working hand, serving as a constant reminder of an engineer's obligation to the public.

At waterloo, the actual part where students receive their rings is called the Iron Ring Ceremony. However, the event is more than just the ceremony. It is the tradition that graduating classes will pull pranks the night before, have champagne breakfast the next morning, go around engineering building and disrupt classes, attend the ceremony, and have the actual Iron Ring Stag.

I probably only had 10 hours of sleep in 72 hours. I had about 5 hours of sleep in the first 48-hour span because of the real-time course. I had little sleep on Feb. 16 because of all the events going on.Â Originally I wasn't planning on attending IRS, but I was convinced by friends to go and it turned out to be good.



The Obligation: I, Danny Su in the presence of these, my betters and my equals in my Calling, bind myself upon my Honour and Cold Iron, that, to the best of my knowledge and power, I will not henceforward suffer or pass, or be privy to the passing of, Bad Workmanship or Faulty Material in aught that concerns my works before mankind as an Engineer, or in my dealing with my Soul before my Maker.

MY TIME I will not refuse; my Thought I will not grudge, my Care I will not deny towards the honour, use stability and perfection of any works to which I may be called to set my hand.

MY FAIR WAGES for that work I will openly take. My Reputation in my Calling I will honourably guard; but I will in no way go about to compass or wrest judgement or gratification from any one with whom I may deal. And further, I will early and warily strive my uttermost against professional jealousy or the belittling of my working-colleagues in any field of their labour.

FOR MY ASSURED FAILURES and derelictions, I ask pardon beforehand of my better and my equals in my Calling here assembled, praying that in the hour of my temptations, weakness and weariness, the memory of this my Obligation and the company before whom it was entered into, may return to me to aid, comfort and restrain.
