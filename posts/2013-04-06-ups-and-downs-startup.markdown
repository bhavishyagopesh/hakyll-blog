title: Ups and downs of a startup
tags: Start-up, AvidTap
---
It's been about half a year now since I started working on [AvidTap][1]. Through
this time period I've experienced some ups and downs associated with working for
yourself. Some of these experiences further solidifies my belief that talk is
pointless and action is more important.


# Your Idea Will Change

Wouldn't it be great to just think of something, implement it and off it goes
to great success? Well, that's not what happened with us. When Geoff, Kaz and I
got together, we had an idea of how we'll implement our solution. Turns out
after further experiments, we had to make the painful decision to completely
toss that idea out. This early setback didn't deter us. Instead we searched for
other ideas and came to our second solution. However, after some time
implementing the second idea, it turned out that it was unreliable so we had to
move past that too. If we spent more time we might have gotten the second idea
to a reliable state, but by this time we had came up with an even better
(**UPDATE:** patent pending) solution which should be released soon.

To everyone out there still just dreaming about your idea, better snap out of
that daydream and get to work.


# Rejections

During the past 6 months, we applied to some accelerators but we didn't get in.
I can't say rejection feels good, but frankly we were too busy to dwell on it.

My attitude is "I'll show you!" when facing doubters. I think this attitude
comes from being an immigrant in Canada. When I was in grade 8, my classmates
thought I was stupid just because I couldn't understand English.

It didn't matter whether other people believe in our team and idea, what we
needed to prove is to ourselves that this can work. People will jump on the
success when AvidTap starts taking off. This is also why I never just talk about
an idea at Microsoft. I build a prototype demonstrating that the idea can work
and then pitch to people.


# Great Success

Of course it's not all sad and depressing. There are many moments of joy that I
enjoyed. Like getting VentureStart funding, winning best new product at Coffee
Fest 2013, and hearing store owners tell us they like our product better than
competitors'.

The ultimate joy will be when we're able to massively scale this. After some
experiements at our early stores, it's great to see people start using AvidTap
and use it repeatedly. 2013 will be an interesting year filled with ups and
downs. To that I say "Bring It!".
