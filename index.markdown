title: Hello!

My name is Danny Su, Co-founder & CTO of [Kash Corp][1] (YC S14). Our mission is to get rid of
the evil tax that is credit card fees.

Previously I worked at Microsoft on Windows Phone. I also worked at Canadian
start-up Well.ca and led their mobile apps and warehouse software efforts.
