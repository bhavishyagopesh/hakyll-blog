My name is Danny Su, Co-Founder of [Kash Corp][1] (YC S14). Our mission is to get rid of
the evil tax that is credit card fees. We're [hiring][2]!

Previously I worked at Microsoft on Windows Phone. I also worked at Canadian
start-up Well.ca and led their mobile apps and warehouse software efforts.
