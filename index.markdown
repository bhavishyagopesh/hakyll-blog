My name is Danny Su, Co-founder of [Kash Corp][1] (YC S14). Our mission is to get rid of
the evil tax that is credit card fees. We're [hiring][2]!

Previously I worked at Microsoft on the Windows Phone 7 Bing Maps application. I
also worked at Canadian start-up Well.ca on their mobile apps and led their
warehouse software team.
